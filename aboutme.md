<br> 

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University in Milan working with [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/). I am part of the ERC project [NEMESIS](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/nemesis.html). 
  
I did a PhD in Applied Mathematics at [Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) in [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team, under the supervisation of [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) and [Guillaume Kon Kam King](https://sites.google.com/site/guillaumekonkamking/).
During my PhD, I did a visiting research in the Department of Statistical Sciences at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) (USA) working with [Filippo Ascolani](https://filippoascolani.github.io/). My thesis focuses on the inference of the number of clusters in Bayesian non-parametric mixture models, particularly on the asymptotic properties of these models.

Before, I did the [Stat-ML Master](https://master-statml.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) at Université Paris-Saclay in 2021.
